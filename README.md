# Different Models Used
# 1. BMI-Calculator
File Location -> bmi_calculator.py<br>

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple and widely used method for assessing an individual's body weight relative to their height. It is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters (kg/mÂ²). Here are some reasons why BMI is useful:
The BMI categories used in this application are:
- Underweight: BMI < 18.5
- Normal weight: 18.5 <= BMI < 24.9
- Overweight: 25 <= BMI < 29.9
- Obese: BMI >= 30

# 2. Diabetes Predictor 
File Location -> colab_files_to_train_models -> Multiple disease prediction system - diabetes.ipynb<br>
Dataset Location -> dataset -> diabetes.csv

The algorithm being developed for this research uses machine learning to forecast an individual's risk of developing diabetes based on a number of different health indicators. Using Streamlit as the UI framework, the application lets users enter pertinent health information and get estimates of their risk of developing diabetes<br>
Features<br>
- Input health parameters including glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, age, etc.
- Predict the likelihood of diabetes based on the input parameters.
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- Visualize the results and health data easily.

This Model is build over Support Vector Classifier, A Machine Learning Model and Provides a accuracy of 77% over the test data
